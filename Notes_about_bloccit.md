1. I needed to use "matching" instead for "simple" in git config.
2. After starting Rails in Static pages checkpoint I got this:
```
ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable in Welcome#about

```
3. When I am trying rspec from welcome_controller_spec.rb, I am getting error, but if I "move" a few steps back, start rspec from bloccit folder, then everything is fine. Why?
