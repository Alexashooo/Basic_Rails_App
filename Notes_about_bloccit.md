1. I needed to use "matching" instead for "simple" in git config.
2. After starting Rails in Static pages checkpoint I got this:
```
ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable in Welcome#about
How to know which gems to install?

```
3. If I type just welcome_controller_spec.rb and run rspec, then I am geting error, but if I am trying to rub from bloccit folder (few steps back) then everything works.
